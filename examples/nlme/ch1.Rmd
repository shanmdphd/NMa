title: mixed effects in S

Write R code in external R scripts, and use `read_chunk()` to read them into the current document.

```{r include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(nlme)
library(knitr)
knitr::read_chunk('ch01.R')
```

The following two chunks are from the external R script `113-foo.R`:

```{r start}
```

# Chapter 1    Linear Mixed-Effects Models: Basic Concepts and Examples

## 1.1 A Simple Example of Random Effects 

```{r}
plot(Rail)
```

```{r 1.1}
```

## 1.2 A Randomized Block Design

```{r}
ggplot(ergoStool, aes(x=Type, y=effort)) + geom_point()
```

```{r 1.2}
```

## 1.3 Mixed-effects Models for Replicated, Blocked Designs
```{r 1.3}
```

## 1.4 An Analysis of Covariance Model
```{r 1.4}
```

## 1.5  Models for Nested Classification Factors
```{r 1.5}
```

## 1.6  A Split-Plot Experiment
```{r 1.6}
```
